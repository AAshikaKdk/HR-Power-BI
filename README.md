# HR-Power-BI

Power BI is an exceptionally powerful and versatile business intelligence tool that empowers organizations to gain valuable insights from their data. With its comprehensive suite of features and intuitive interface, Power BI enables users to transform raw data into visually compelling and interactive reports, dashboards, and visualizations. Employees are the first and most important assets of a company. With the help of Power BI, I have created an HR dashboard that provides the board of directors with all the insights they are seeking about the staff.
